# database dump:
pg_dump -v -U image-a-day -F c -f image-a-day.dump image-a-day_production

# database restore:
#   pg_restore -c -C -F c -v -U image-a-day -W -d image-a-day_production image-a-day.dump
#   sudo -u postgres pg_restore -c -C -F c -v -U image-a-day image-a-day.dump
# this is complicated, what needed to be done to get it working was:
bundle exec rake db:drop
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
sudo -u postgres pg_restore -d image-a-day_production -a -c -Fc -v image-a-day.dump
